# 🌐 Enterprise Network Simulation (Cisco Packet Tracer)

## 🚀 Overview 
This project is a simulated snterprise network built in Cisco Packet Tracer. It demonstrates key networking concepts including subnetting, DHCP, DNS, server integration, WAN/LAN segmentation, firewall rules, and multi-site connectivity.

## 🏗️ Features
- 🔀 **Multiple Subnets** (3 LANs)
- 🌍 **WAN and DMZ Segmentation**
- 🖥️ **Servers:** DHCP, DNS, Web Server, etc.
- 🔒 **Cisco ASA Firewall Integration**
- 📶 **Wireless and Wired Clients**
- 💻 **Laptops, PCs, Smartphones**
- 📡 **Access Points**
- 🛣️ **RIP Routing Protocol**
- 🏠 **Custom HTML Welcome Page**

## 📝 How to Use
1. **Download** the `.pkt` file and open in Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x or later.
2. **Review** the topology and configurations.
3. **Power on** all devices.
4. **Test connectivity** (ping, web browser, DHCP, etc).
5. **Browse** the web server via any PC in the simulation.
